## Architecture

Model Hosting - Development:

-  Dan's local LLaMA model.
-  AWS Sagemaker serverless inference with Free Tier. Max memory 6GB, which can run the LLaMA 7B model, and hopefully the 13B. Sagemaker offers many different models.
   -  150,000 seconds per month for the first 2 months.

Model Hosting - Production:

-  Host LLaMA2 on an [AWS EC2 C5](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/) instance.
   -  Can use c5n.4xlarge, the cheapest option that can run LLaMA2 70B (42GB GPU memory). $1.024 per hour.
   -  Can use serverless inference, real-time inference, or asynchronous inference depending on budget etc.
-  Give users option to choose their preferred LLM.
-  Storage on AWS S3.

General:

-  Host everything else on Vercel.
-  Prompt formatting on frontend in Next.js.
-  Python and Flask on backend, sending prompts to LLaMA model and transmitting output.

## Run
